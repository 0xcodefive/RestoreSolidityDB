After some actions or updates in Remix, all my contracts disappeared. However, they were still located in IndexedDB. It seems that some binding to the database was broken. I wrote a script that allows me to save all existing contracts from IndexedDB without other metadata. Here is where you can get the source files for parsing:

```%LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\IndexedDB\https_remix.ethereum.org_0.indexeddb.blob\2```
